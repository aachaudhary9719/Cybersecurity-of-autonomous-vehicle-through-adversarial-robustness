# CYBERSECURITY-OF-AUTONOMOUS-VEHICLES-THROUGH-ADVERSARIAL-ROBUSTNESS
This project enhances the security of autonomous vehicles by identifying and addressing adversarial attacks that could compromise safety. It continuously monitors sensor data and communication systems to detect anomalies caused by malicious inputs. When an attack is detected, the system triggers countermeasures to mitigate its impact, such as correcting corrupted data or alerting the vehicle. By ensuring secure and uninterrupted operation, this project reduces the risk of accidents and system failures. It is especially beneficial in safeguarding autonomous vehicles in real-world scenarios, where cybersecurity threats could endanger passengers, other road users, and infrastructure.
